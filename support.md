Wave works entirely on your device.

Frequently Asked Questions

Does Wave upload my files to the cloud?

No.
Wave processes and stores all data locally on your Mac.

No files, embeddings, or metadata are sent to external servers.

⸻

Why do I need to select folders?

Wave only indexes folders you explicitly choose.
You are always in control of what gets analyzed.

⸻

What does “Connected” mean in Settings?

If you also use the companion app Trace, Wave can sync metadata through a shared App Group container.

This is optional and happens locally on your device.

⸻

How do I reindex a folder?

Right-click a folder in the sidebar and choose Reindex.

⸻

How can I remove a folder?

Right-click the folder and choose Remove.
This removes indexed data inside Wave, not the actual files on disk.

⸻

Troubleshooting

If search results seem incomplete:

• Try reindexing the folder
• Restart the app
• Make sure the folder is still accessible
